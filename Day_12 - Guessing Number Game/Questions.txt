Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard':

hard - You have 5 attempts remaining to guess the number.
easy - You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number.

Make a guess:

- Too high.
- or -
- Too Low.
Guess again.
You have x attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 


You've run out of guesses, you lose.

You got it! The answer was 14.
